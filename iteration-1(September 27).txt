Hi Justin,



I'm happy to share.  I'm a criminal defense attorney.  I own my own law firm, which you can look at at www.bransonwestlaw.com.  I previously worked at another criminal defense law firm.  I went to law school at the University of Utah, but did my undergrad at BYU.  I graduated with a BS in Information Systems, which is through the business school there.  It was probably 70% business 30% computers.  I had maybe three classes in programming and web development, a couple in db administration and theory, a couple of hardware classes, and most of the rest was business related in my major.



I have worked at one other law firm that did credit repair and consumer law.  I also worked at IHC in their Information Systems department, where I drafted HIPAA policy for the company for 2 1/2 years.  In my spare time, I also do some intellectual property law consulting (copyright/trademark stuff), and I'm also an NFL agent.



Hopefully that gives you a little bit of a background on me.  If you have other questions, let me know.



Thanks,

Branson K. West

Branson,

Our team would like to keep in contact with you for our Software Engineering class at UVU.  We are excited to work with you to help us define the Goal Tracking project we are going to be working on this semester.   Do you mind sharing some information about yourself, such as your profession, background, and experiences?  We will contact you again this Thursday (via email) to discuss more detailed requirements about the project.  Please reply to our emails using the "Reply All" button in your email, so our team can all stay on the email thread.

Thanks,

Justin and the Team

That looks great.  Now, if you were to develop it for iPhone, I'm assuming this is web-based (ie accessible through a browser) and not a full app via the app store, correct?  I mean, I'd love the latter, but I assume that would be far more work than this project is intended to cover.



Thanks,

Branson K. West

Good morning Branson,



Thank-you for taking the time on the phone to discuss details regarding your project.  Per our discussion I've prepared the following summary:



Web-based application accessible via PC and mobile phone (prefer iphone)

Goal and sub-goal (Milestone) reminders (prefer text but email is ok)

Each goal will have the following:

        A title (ie Prepare & send the Jones' appeal letter)

        A due date

        Milestones w/ titles (ie prepare the Jones' appeal letter, mail the Jones' appeal letter, etc) and due dates

Please advise if I have missed anything



Sincerely,



Dan Davis

User Interaction:

Hi Brian,

I apologize for the delay.  I thought I had responded, but looked back
and realized that I must have typed a response and not hit send.  In
any event, I have looked at it, and I appreciate the background that
was...borrowed :)  The rest certainly appears functional, if not
elegant.  I'll be very interested to see a working model.  Let me know
when that appears.

As to suggestions, (and maybe an explanation for the "not elegant"
comment) the UI is simply a big gray box, which frankly doesn't need
that much space, so it's visually unpleasant.   But, beyond that, and
more importantly, it's unnecessary and diverges from industry standard
to have the registration on the same page as the login.  Most sites
have a registration link, but most users would not want to be
presented with a registration on the same page as the actual login.
Where they are identical parameters, it appears confusing.  I could
see myself accidentally entering my login info into the registration
boxes and being frustrated when it tells me a user by that id already
exists.  So, my suggestion is to make them two separate pages.  But if
not, like I say, I think it would still work, it just wouldn't be as
nice.

Thanks,
Branson K. West

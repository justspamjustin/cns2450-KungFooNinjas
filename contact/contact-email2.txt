That looks great.  Now, if you were to develop it for iPhone, I'm assuming this is web-based (ie accessible through a browser) and not a full app via the app store, correct?  I mean, I'd love the latter, but I assume that would be far more work than this project is intended to cover.

Thanks,

Good morning Branson,

Thank-you for taking the time on the phone to discuss details regarding your project.  Per our discussion I've prepared the following summary:

Web-based application accessible via PC and mobile phone (prefer iphone)
Goal and sub-goal (Milestone) reminders (prefer text but email is ok)
Each goal will have the following:
        A title (ie Prepare & send the Jones' appeal letter)
        A due date
        Milestones w/ titles (ie prepare the Jones' appeal letter, mail the Jones' appeal letter, etc) and due dates
Please advise if I have missed anything

Sincerely,

Dan Davis

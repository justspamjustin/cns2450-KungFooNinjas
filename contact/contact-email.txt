Hi Justin,

I'm happy to share.  I'm a criminal defense attorney.  I own my own law firm, which you can look at at www.bransonwestlaw.com.  I previously worked at another criminal defense law firm.  I went to law school at the University of Utah, but did my undergrad at BYU.  I graduated with a BS in Information Systems, which is through the business school there.  It was probably 70% business 30% computers.  I had maybe three classes in programming and web development, a couple in db administration and theory, a couple of hardware classes, and most of the rest was business related in my major.

I have worked at one other law firm that did credit repair and consumer law.  I also worked at IHC in their Information Systems department, where I drafted HIPAA policy for the company for 2 1/2 years.  In my spare time, I also do some intellectual property law consulting (copyright/trademark stuff), and I'm also an NFL agent.

Hopefully that gives you a little bit of a background on me.  If you have other questions, let me know.

Thanks,
Branson K. West
